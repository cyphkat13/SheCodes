      <h4>Defining <em>Dressage</em></h4>
      <p>
        The images of top level dressage riders executing intricate movements in
        a tailcoat may seem out of reach to some, but dressage is about so much
        more. The word 'dressage' comes from the French term, 'dresseur' meaning
        'training' and adding just a few minutes of it into your daily routine
        can help in many ways. Dressage is all about learning to work with your
        horse and help him achieve greater suppleness, flexibility and
        obedience; enhance his natural movements and ability and improve his
        athleticism. It's for exactly these reasons that dressage was originally
        developed by the cavalry in the 17th century â€“ after all, having an
        unresponsive or undisciplined horse on the battlefield could have meant
        the difference between life or death. Only later did it develop into
        some of the more flamboyant moves still seen today at the Spanish Riding
        School of Vienna. As with many equestrian sports, necessity on the
        battlefield, developed into the sporting spectacle we now enjoy. As a
        sport, dressage is all about putting training into practice in front of
        a judge (or judges) to show how the horse's development is progressing
        against a set ideal. From the lowest level to the pinnacle, horse and
        rider perform movements in a rectangular arena and are awarded marks for
        their efforts by a judge or panel of judges.
